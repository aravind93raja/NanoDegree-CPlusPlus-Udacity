# NanoDegree Program on C++ 

## Collection of Projects part of the [C++ NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) program by Udacity

The furthur details for every project :

1) Setup & Build Instruction

2) Sample Results 

have been provided in the README.md of each repository 

### 1) Project - Route Planning

Use OpenStreetMap data and look at IO2D map display code. 
Extend the IO2D map display code to use A*,
so the program will be able to find a path between two points
on the map.The program will find
a path along the city streets to connect the start and end

### 2) Project - System Monitor

A Linux system monitor with similar functionality to the widely
used htop application.

This will not only provide you more familiarity
the Linux operating system, but also give you insights into how a
collection of objects can function together in C++ to form an exciting
and complete application!

### 3) Project - Memory Management Chatbot

The ChatBot project creates a dialogue where users can ask questions
about some aspects of memory management in C++. 
The project has been optimized with memory management in mind using
modern concepts such as smart pointers and move semantics.

### 4) Project - Concurrent Traffic Simulation

Building a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map.
Running each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections
to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions using state-of-the-art
concurrency concepts.
